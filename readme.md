# CG's custom nodes: Randoms

[Index of my custom nodes](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-nodes-index)

## Randoms

To install:
```
cd [path to ComfyUI]/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-randoms.git
```

A set of custom nodes for doing things randomly. They each operate in an isolated `SeedContext`, meaning that they save the state of the random number system, reseed it, do their thing, and then restore the state. In practice this means that adding one of these nodes doesn't change the sequence of random numbers generated by other nodes, so they don't break reproducability.

A configuration file is used for some of the nodes - rename `configuration.example.yaml` as `configuration.yaml` and edit it appropriately.

## Numbers

- `RandomInt`
- `RandomFloat` 

## Loaders

The random loaders can be made to cycle through the options systematically instead of randomly by setting the seed to 0.

- `LoadRandomLora` loads a random LoRA. The LoRAs to be chosen from are listed in `configuration.yaml`; they must be in the LoRA directory, and are assumed to be `.safetensor` unless an extension is given. The configuration file is read at execution time, so you can make changes without restarting ComfyUI.
