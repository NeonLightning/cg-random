## Randoms

To install:
```
cd [path to ComfyUI]/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-random.git
```

A set of custom nodes for doing things randomly. They each operate in an isolated `SeedContext`, meaning that they save the state of the random number system, reseed, do their thing, and then restore the state. In practice this means that adding one of these nodes doesn't change the sequence of random numbers generated by other nodes, so they don't break reproducability.

## Numbers

- `Random Int`
- `Random Float` 

## Loaders

The following apply to all random loaders:
- If the optional name input is used, this takes priority over the random/systematic behaviour
- The configuration file is required - see notes in `configuration.example.yaml`
- If the seed is set to `0`, the loader will cycle systematically through the options instead of being random.
- The list of options is loaded from the configuration file or directory at execution time, so can be changed without restart.
- The workflow saved with the image will not contain name of the item randomly selected. Consider using the [Metadata](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-quicknodes) custom nodes to capture and reuse the names.

The loaders available are:
- `Load Random Lora` loads a random LoRA
- `Load Random Checkpoint` loads a random checkpoint
- `Load Random Image` loads a random image from a specified directory
