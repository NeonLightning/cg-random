Here's an updated version of the documentation to align with the current version of the loaders in your code. It includes the `follow_subfolders` option and ensures all recent functionality is covered.

# CG's Custom Nodes: Randoms

[Like my nodes? Buy me a coffee?](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrisgoringe)

## Randoms

A set of custom nodes for doing things randomly in an isolated `SeedContext`. This means they save the state of the random number system, reseed, do their thing, and then restore the state. In practice, this means that adding one of these nodes doesn't change the sequence of random numbers generated by other nodes, *so they don't break reproducibility*.

You can also use these nodes to do things systematically (cycling through all options one at a time).

### Installation:
```
cd [path to ComfyUI]/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-random.git
```

### Updating:
```
cd [path to ComfyUI]/custom_nodes/cg-random
git pull
```

## Random Number Nodes

- `Random Int`
- `Random Float`
- `Systematic Int`
- `Systematic Float`

Each node accepts a `minimum` and a `maximum` value.

- `Random ...` generates a random value between `minimum` and `maximum` (inclusive).
- `Systematic ...` uses a `step` value that is added each time (wrapping when reaching the `max`). It also has a `reset` option to force the value to return to `minimum`. `step` can be negative (wrapping at `min` and resetting to `max`).
- `... Float` nodes have an optional `decimal_places` parameter to round the output. Note that rounding occurs last, which may cause values to fall outside the given range (e.g., if `maximum=0.899` and `decimal_places=1`, a generated value of `0.88` could be rounded to `0.9`).

## Random Checkpoint, LoRA, and Image Loaders

These nodes allow you to load checkpoints, LoRAs, or images randomly or systematically.

### Checkpoint & LoRA Loaders

For `LoadRandomCheckpoint` and `LoadRandomLora`, create a directory inside the respective folders (`models/Stable-diffusion` for checkpoints or `models/Lora` for LoRAs) named `random`. Add the models you want to be randomly selected.

#### Parameters:
- `keep_for`: The number of times a model is used before selecting a new one. Default is `1` (random selection each time). If running many batches or permutations, increasing `keep_for` reduces loading time.
- `mode`:  
  - `"random"`: Selects models randomly.  
  - `"systematic"`: Cycles through the models in order, keeping each one for `keep_for` runs before moving to the next.
- `follow_subfolders`: If enabled, the loader will also search within subdirectories of `random` for models.

### Random Image Loader

For `LoadRandomImage`, specify:
- `folder`: The directory containing images.
- `extensions`: A comma-separated list of file types to recognize as images (e.g., `.png, .jpg, .jpeg`).

The image loader selects a random image from the given directory. If `follow_subfolders` is enabled, it will also search within subdirectories.
